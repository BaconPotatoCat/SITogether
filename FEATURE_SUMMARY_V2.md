# 🎉 Feature Update: Locked Intro Messages

## What Changed

You requested the ability for users to send an introductory message when they like someone, with the message staying locked until the recipient also matches with them.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 🆕 New Feature: Locked Intro Messages

### How It Works

1. **User clicks "Like"** → Modal appears
2. **User chooses:**
   - 💌 Send with intro message (optional, up to 200 chars)
   - ❤️ Like without message
   - Cancel
3. **If intro message sent:**
   - Message stored with `isLocked: true`
   - Not visible to recipient yet
4. **When recipient likes back:**
   - ✅ Match created
   - 🔓 Intro message unlocks
   - 💬 Conversation created with unlocked message
   - Both can now chat freely

---

## 📊 Implementation Details

### Database Changes

**Updated Message Model:**
```prisma
model Message {
  conversationId String?  // Made optional (intro messages have no conversation yet)
  isLocked       Boolean  @default(false)  // NEW: Tracks locked state
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Backend Changes

**1. Match Endpoint Enhanced:**
- Now accepts optional `introMessage` parameter
- Creates locked message when like + message provided
- Automatically unlocks messages on mutual match

**2. Message Fetching Updated:**
- Only returns unlocked messages
- Filters out locked messages from API responses

**3. Auto-Unlock Logic:**
- When mutual match occurs:
  - Find all locked messages between users
  - Unlock them (`isLocked: false`)
  - Link to new conversation
  - Both users see messages immediately

### Frontend Changes

**New Modal UI:**
- Beautiful intro message composer
- Character counter (0/200)
- Three clear action buttons
- Clean, modern design

**Updated Like Flow:**
- Like button opens modal (instead of immediate like)
- Modal provides choice: message, no message, or cancel
- Smooth animations and transitions

---
